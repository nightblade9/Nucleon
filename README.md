# Nucleon

:warning: Nucleon is still a proof-of-concept, and is not production ready! :warning:

Build a cross-platform PC app or game with .NET technologies. Inspired by Electron.NET and friends.

# Developer Experience

Using VSCode, run the solution. It should launch two windows: a stand-alone browser (which you can close), and a Chromium window for your app. You can browse either one, and VSCode will automatically hit all the breakpoints you've set.
